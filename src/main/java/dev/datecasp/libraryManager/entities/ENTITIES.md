# Entities package

This package contains the classes that represent the entities in the database.

There is one class for each entity, stored in a database table, and based in the real life models we need to manage in the library.

* Entities:
  * ``Book`` -> Model for the books.
  * ``User`` -> Model for the users of the library.
  * ``GrantedUser`` -> Model for the authority users that are allowed to access the database.
